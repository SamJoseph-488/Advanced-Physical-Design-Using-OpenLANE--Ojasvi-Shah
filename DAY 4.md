# SKY130 DAY 4 : Pre-Layout Timing Analysis and Importance of Good Clock Tree
## Timing Modelling Using Delay Tables
### Lab Steps To Convert Grid Information Into Track Information

_sky130_inv.mag_ located in _vsdstdcelldesign_ directory contains all information like PG and port information, logic etc. OpenLANE is a PnR tool and hence does not require the full information present in the _.mag_ file. The only information that we require are the boundary, power and ground rails, and the inputs & outputs information. This is the reason of we use **.lef** files. Hence, our next  objective is to extract the LEF file from the MAGIC file and plug that into the picorv32a design. The guidelines to be followed while making a standard cell are -:

1. The input and output ports must lie at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical tracks (this is to ensure the routes can reach the ports).
2. The width and height of the standard cell must be odd multiples of the track's horizontal and vertical pitch respectively

> Tracks refer to the horizontal and vertical metal layers on which routing occurs. The grid formed by the intersection of horizontal and vertical tracks creates a routing grid, also k/a a routing matrix.

The ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/openlane/sky130_fd_sc_hd/tracks.info contains track information. Before and After changing the grid values -:

Hence, we are able to satisfy the first guideline.

Then, we are able to satisfy the second guideline as follows -:

### Lab Steps to Convert Magic Layout to STD Cell LEF

LEF [Library Exchange Format] which contains information of the standard cell library used in the design. They contain detailed information about the geometric shapes, sizes, layers, and other physical properties of individual cells or macros within the library. The instructions to set the port definitions are available [here](https://github.com/nickson-jose/vsdstdcelldesign#create-port-definition). Next, save the _.mag_ file with a new filename by typing _**lef write**_ in the tkcon terminal, which will generate a new **lef** file with the new filename -:

### Introduction of Timing **libs** and Steps To Include New Cell in Synthesis

Inside this directory [_pdks/sky130A/libs.ref/sky130_fd_sc_hd/lib/_] are the liberty timing files for SKY130 PDK which have the timing and power parameters for each cell needed in STA. It can either be slow, typical, fast with different supply voltages (1v80, 1v65, 1v95), which are called PVT corners. The library named **sky130_fd_sc_hd__ss_025C_1v80** describes the PVT corner as slow-slow [ie. delay is maximum], 25Â° Celsius temperature, at 1.8V power supply. Timing and power parameter of a cell are obtained by simulating the cell in a variety of operating conditions [i.e. different corners] and this data is represented in the liberty file, which characterizes all cells and is used during ABC mapping during synthesis stage which maps the generic cells to the actual standard cells available in the liberty file.

- Firstly, copy the extracted lef file - named _**sky130_vsdinv.lef**_ and the liberty files named _**sky130*.lib**_ from this repository - _**/openlane/vsdstdcelldesign/libs**_ to the **src** directory of **picorv32a**.

  ![image](https://github.com/ojasvi-shah/Advanced-Physical-Design-Using-OpenLANE--Ojasvi-Shah/assets/163879237/9cdf6857-1eb6-4d9a-954d-83d46acf3548)

- Subsequently, add the following to the _**config.tcl**_ file inside the _picorv32a_ directory. Through this, we are setting the liberty file that will be used for ABC mapping of synthesis (LIB_SYNTH) and for STA (_FASTEST,_SLOWEST,_TYPICAL) and also the extra LEF files (EXTRA_LEFS) for the customized inverter cell.

-   After this, invoke the _**docker**_ command and prepare the _**picorv32a**_ design. Plug the new _lef_ file to the OpenLANE flow through the following commands

> docker
>
> 
> ./flow.tcl -interactive
>
> 
> package require openlane 0.9
>
> 
> prep -design picorv32a
>
> 
> set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
>
> 
> add_lefs -src $lefs
>
> 
> This will generate the following picture -:

- Then, run synthesis using the _run_synthesis_ command and check that sky130_vsdinv cell is successfully included in the design

### Delay Tables

![image](https://github.com/ojasvi-shah/Advanced-Physical-Design-Using-OpenLANE--Ojasvi-Shah/assets/163879237/17a6e767-5d3e-418b-82f6-bd46df41d0cc)

The above image depicts to us how the enable pin affects the CLK propogation. In case of AND gate, ONLY when the enable pin is equal to 1, the CLK propogates to Y. Similarly, in case of OR gate, the CLK propogates to Y only when the enable pin is 0. Whenever the enable pin is equal to 1, the CLK does not propogate and there is no short circuit power consumption. Switching power consumption when such elemements are used is used in CLOCK TREE. This method is known as Clock Gating Technique.

However, when we think of this, the question that arises is _**HOW DOES ONE USE THIS?**_ For this purpose, consider the below clock tree structure -:

![image](https://github.com/ojasvi-shah/Advanced-Physical-Design-Using-OpenLANE--Ojasvi-Shah/assets/163879237/db284022-8ee5-4145-ba0d-920fdfd1de59)

We see through the above picture that buffers on different levels have different capacitive loads and buffer sizes but as long as they have the same loads and sizes in the same level, the total delay for each clock tree path will be the same and, so skew will remain zero. However, we can observe that practically, different levels can have varying input transition and output capacitive load and hence varying delay.

We use delay tables to observe each cell's timing models that is included inside the _.lef_ files. The element that majorly impacts delay is _output slew_, which depends on capacitative load and the input slew [which is a function of previous stage buffer's output capacitive load and input slew and has its own transition delay table.]

![image](https://github.com/ojasvi-shah/Advanced-Physical-Design-Using-OpenLANE--Ojasvi-Shah/assets/163879237/27168e84-7202-48bb-9e87-9ca3e0131c91)

We notice at level 2 that both buffers have identical delays due to equal transition times, load capacitances and buffers sizes. Subsequently, we see that the _skew_ is zero. However if this is not true, the skew will be negative, which will cause timing violations. On a small scale, these are often considered to be insignificant but we see their importance in large designs which millions of cells, where in if we fail to adhere to guidelines during clock tree creation, many timing-related complications can be caused.

> CTS is the process of designing a clock distribution network to minimize skew and ensure synchronous operation of the circuit
> 
> Skew refers to the variation in clock signal arrival times, and slew [rate] is the rate of change of signal's voltage on time
> 
> Latency is the delay experienced by the clock signal

### Lab Steps To Configure Synthesis Settings to Fix Slack and Include VSDINV

We can see through previous pictures that currently, 
- tns = -711.59
- wns = -23.89
- chip area for the module picorv32a = 147712.9184

Hence, our next step is to try to make the synthesis more **timing driven**. This can be done as follows-:

1. Firstly, check synthesis strategy and other timing related variables and then modify accordingly
    - SYNTH_STRATEGY of delay 0 will mean that the tool will focus more on optimizing the delay
    -  index can changed to be 0, 1, 2, or 3 where 3 is the most optimized for timing at the cost of area.
    -  SYNTH_BUFFERING of 1 will ensure that the buffer will be used on high fanout cells to reduce wire delay.
    -  SYNTH_SIZING of 1 will enable cell sizing where cell will be upsized or downsized as needed to meet timing.
    -  SYNTH_DRIVING_CELL is the cell used to drive the input ports and is vital for cells with a lot of fan-outs since it needs higher drive strength.

2. After this, run synthesis again. It is will be seen that area is increased but there is no negative slack
     + tns = 0
     + wns = 0
     + Chip area for module picorv32a = 209181.872

![image](https://github.com/ojasvi-shah/Advanced-Physical-Design-Using-OpenLANE--Ojasvi-Shah/assets/163879237/7d194ab7-bf43-438e-91a0-725386bd61dc)

3. Subsequently, we may run floorplan and placement

> NOTE : If any error comes related to macro placement, temporary solution is to comment **basic_macro_placement** inside the file **OpenLane/scripts/tcl_commands/floorplan.tcl** (this is okay since we are not adding any macro to the design).
>
> We can also execute the following commands:-
> 
> init_floorplan
> 
> place_io
>
> global_placement_or
>
> detailed_placement
>
> tap_decap_or
>
> detailed_placement

After successful run, **runs/[date]/results/placement/picorv32a.placement.def** will be created:-

![image](https://github.com/ojasvi-shah/Advanced-Physical-Design-Using-OpenLANE--Ojasvi-Shah/assets/163879237/fad383de-088c-49c9-8571-5ba57734cab3)

4. After this, search for instance of cell **sky130_vsdinv** inside the DEF file after the placement stage through this command **cat picorv32a.placement.def | grep sky130_vsdinv**

5. Then, select a single **sky130_vsdinv** cell instance from the list dumped by grep (e.g. 41096). On tkcon, command **select cell 41096** may be run. Press ctrl+z to zoom into that cell. As shown below, our customized inverter cell sky130_myinverter is sucessfully placed. Use the **expand** command on tkcon to show the footprint of the cell and notice how the power and ground of sky130_vsdinv overlaps the power and ground pins of its adjacent cells -:

## Timing Analysis With Ideal Clocks Using Open STA
### Setup Timing Analysis And Introduction to Flip-Flop Setup Time

Consider an ideal clock [i.e. a clock tree is not built yet] where perform timing analysis to understand the parameters [later the same can be done using real clocks]. Specifications are as mentioned in the picture [Clock frequncy (F) is 1GHz and clock period (T) is 1ns]. -:

![image](https://github.com/ojasvi-shah/Advanced-Physical-Design-Using-OpenLANE--Ojasvi-Shah/assets/163879237/39437ad9-3953-4955-ac5f-e15c60e3adf0)

![image](https://github.com/ojasvi-shah/Advanced-Physical-Design-Using-OpenLANE--Ojasvi-Shah/assets/163879237/f12cdcd3-e080-4d25-977c-aed998a2e060)

The setup timing analysis equation is = Î < T - S

> Î = Combinational delay which includes clk to Q delay of launch flop and internal propagation delay of all gates between launch and capture flop
> 
> T = Time period, also called the required time
> 
> S = Setup time. As demonstrated below, signal must settle on the middle (input of Mux 2) before clock tansists to 1 so the delay due to Mux 1 must be considered, this delay is the setup time.

### Introduction to Clock Jitter and Uncertainty

CLK signals are sent to the device by the PLL (Phase Locked Loop). This clock source is expected to send clock signal at 0, T, 2T etc. However, even these clock sources might or might not be able to provide a clock **exactly** at Tns because of its own in-built variation known as jitter. Jitter can be thought of as short-term fluctuations in the timing of signal transitions, which can result in deviations from the expected clock or data timing.

![image](https://github.com/ojasvi-shah/Advanced-Physical-Design-Using-OpenLANE--Ojasvi-Shah/assets/163879237/a298949c-3101-44c3-b15a-d60efbc9eca8)
![image](https://github.com/ojasvi-shah/Advanced-Physical-Design-Using-OpenLANE--Ojasvi-Shah/assets/163879237/ca549e3e-4895-4a62-b3e6-4924e2394d2d)

Hence, we see that a more realistic equation for setup time is = Î < T - S - SU

> SU = Setup uncertainty due to jitter which is temporary variation of clock period, which is due to non-idealities of PLL.
